# SDLC-CS250

Throughtout this course I followed SNHU Travel, and took roles as different members of the agile team. As the product owner, I focused on gathering requirements from users, and other stakeholders. Furthermore, I used agile processes for customer feedback and collaboration through an iterative process. This process helped with understand what requirements stakeholders felt were the most important, so that we could make accurate size user stories. Through the iterative nature of sprints, our devlopment had to stay flexible since customer requirements could always change. The development team ensured that processes properly reflected stories, and fulfilled the customers expectations. Lastly, I focused on the team through being transparent in things like daily scrum meetings and retrospectives, so that everyone knew what work was being done.
